Welcome to Boundless Exchange Documentation!
============================================

Boundless Exchange is a web-based platform for your content, built for your enterprise. It facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. For power users, advanced editing capabilities for versioned workflows via the web browser are included. Boundless Exchange is powered by GeoNode, GeoGig, OpenLayers, PostGIS, GeoServer and pycsw. Boundless Exchange is designed as a platform for collaboration. You can now focus on your community – getting stakeholders quickly involved and empowering them with information. Exchange supports communal editing – allowing you to crowd-source information in an online, powerful, distributed/versioned architecture with an intuitive user interface.
